      <h3>Conflict with Bijapur sultanate</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji Maharaj took the Torna Fort, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the
        Bijapur
        court due to the ailment of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found there. In the
        following two years, Shivaji Maharaj took several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana and
        Chakan.
        Also, he brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati and Indapur under his direct control. He used the
        treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad.That fort served as the seat of his government for over
        a decade. After this, Shivaji Maharaj turned west to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of
        Kalyan.
        Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action. On 25 July 1648, Shahaji Maharaj was
        imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar called, Baji Ghorpade under the orders of Bijapur government, in a bid to
        contain Shivaji Maharaj.</p>

    <div class="conflict-mughal">
      <h3>Conflict with the Mughals</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Until 1657, Shivaji Maharaj maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire. Shivaji Maharaj offered his
        assistance to
        Aurangzeb who then, was the Mughal viceroy of the Deccan and son of the Mughal emperor, in conquering Bijapur in
        return for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages under his possession. Dissatisfied
        with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan.
        Shivaji Maharaj confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji Maharaj officers raided
        the Mughal
        territory near Ahmednagar. This was followed by raids in Junnar, with Shivaji Maharaj carrying off 300,000 hun
        in cash
        and 200 horses. Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji
        Maharaj at
        Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against Shivaji Maharaj were interrupted by the rainy season
        and his
        battle of succession with his brothers for the Mughal throne following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan.

  <div class="coronation" id="coronation">
    <h3>Coronation</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Shivaji Maharaj had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was
      still
      technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain.
      A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha leaders, to whom he was
      technically equal. it would also provide the Hindu Marathas with a fellow Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise
      ruled by Muslims.</p>

    <h3>Expansion of Maratha Empire after Shivaji Maharaj</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Shivaji Maharaj left behind a state always at odds with the Mughals. Soon after his death, in 1681, Aurangzeb
      launched an
      offensive in the South to capture territories held by the Marathas, the Bijapur-based Adilshahi and Qutb Shahi of
      Golkonda respectively. He was successful in obliterating the Sultanates but could not subdue the Marathas after
      spending 27 years in the Deccan. The period saw the capture, torture, and execution of Sambhaji in 1689, and the
      Marathas offering strong resistance under the leadership of Sambhaji's successor, Rajaram and then Rajaram's widow
      Tarabai. Territories changed hands repeatedly between the Mughals and the Marathas; the conflict ended in defeat
      for the Mughals in 1707.</p>

    <h3>Legacy</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Shivaji Maharaj was well known for his strong religious and warrior code of ethics and exemplary character. He
      was
      recognized as a national hero during the Indian Independence Movement. While some accounts of Shivaji Maharaj
      state that
      he was greatly influenced by the Brahmin guru Samarth Ramdas, others have said that Ramdas' role has been
      overemphasised by later Brahmin commentators to enhance their position.</p>
